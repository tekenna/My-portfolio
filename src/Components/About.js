            I am a design-minded, detail oriented web developer passionate about
            combining beautiful, structured codes with nice interfaces and
            desired fuctionalities. I have experience developing and designing
            web interfaces from simple landng pages to multi-paged web
            applications. I always strive to create software that not only
            functions efficiently, but also provides intuitive and perfect user
            experiences. I love learning new and better ways to create seamless
            user experiences with clean and efficient codes. I am open to
            learning and self development and in the process lay on impact on
            any community I'm working in. I'm always looking for opportunities
            to work with those willing to share their knowledge as much as I
            want to learn.
